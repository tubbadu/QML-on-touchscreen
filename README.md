# QML-on-touchscreen
A collection of reusable QML item specifically designed to be used on a touchscreen

(I have already written some of those, I'll tidy them and load when I'll have enough time. Any contribution is welcome!)

## TODOs:
* [ ] sliding object from the edge of the screen (any edge)
* [ ] touchscreen gestures recognizer:
  * [ ] tap
  * [ ] double tap
  * [ ] triple tap
  * [ ] multiple finger tap
  * [ ] swipe up/down/left/right/diagonals
  * [ ] pinch in
  * [ ] pinch out
  * [ ] multiple fingers pinch
  * [ ] swipe from screen edge to the center
* [ ] change page by swiping left/right (with animation)


it would be amazing being able in the future to fork the whole KDE desktop environment to make it completely touchscreen-oriented
